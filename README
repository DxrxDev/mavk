# MAVK

The "Minimal Abstraction for Vulkan" is a framework to simplify the usage of vulkan using C17.

Since this is soley a vulkan framework, there aren't / won't be any tools for window /handling,
maths calculations, handling input events, etc. Instead you are free to use any tools you prefer
for the job. See the RECOMMENDATIONS.3RD PARTY section


==============
# WHY USE MAVK

If you still want the performance of a vulkan application but dont want to write
all the boiler-plate code to get everything up and running. Mavk offers many abstractions
while still having the option to write the lower level vulkan code if desired.


=========
# BUILDING

The easiest way to build this project is to use the included Premake5 file.

If you choose not to use premake, then you must define macros for the following:
	- Platofrm (MAVK_PLATFORM_XXX)
	- Debug setting (MAVK_NDEBUG, MAVK_DEBUG)


=================
# RECOMMENDATIONS

------------
## 3RD PARTY

I recommend using glfw3 for window & surface creation.


I dont recommend programming with vulkan if you are a beginner in graphics programming,
that being said mavk might be a way to ease yourself into the world of vulkan.
